My thoughts

This is the system we are currently working on, but I want to update it in a better way, I will give you my idea point by point,
1. This system should be {1.rough stones - (color gem stones, diamonds), 1.cut and polish stones - (color gem stones, diamonds,) jevellery -(this should be divided into categories, gold sliver any others and low budget jewellerys and had crft like this - from small scale businessmen to large scale businessmen)}
2. This system should be able to list rough stones, (i.e. the necessary valiavtion step should be included when listing a rough stone)
3. Cut and polish gemstones should also be included in the valivation process,
4.(normal users and normal buyers) that is, end customers who buy and use gems and jewelery- should be able to log in normally from the ecommerce system homapage ui,
5.Dealer=(gem seller, People like jewellers, shop owners), cutters, appraisers etc. should go through a separate page that tells them about the importance of this system, just like a seller register system in e-commerce multivendor websites, they should submit the relevant documents, which are manually checked by the admin panel and approved (documents-gem and jewellery license/ business registration/ Id)
6. In this system, from the point of gem mining, someone buying a rough gemstone, cutting and polishing it, processing it all, and finally going to a jeweller or end customer, records should be saved and it should be possible to transfer it to the buyer, and it should appear as a certificate,
7. Dealers=(gem seller, jewellers, shop owners), cutters, appraisers (gemologist) should be able to use the valuation system as a tool,
8. A normal user should also be able to sell a gemstone he has by verifying the ID and record them,
8. Each gemstone should have a unique ID, a long code like a bitcoin wallet address
9.Dealer=(gem seller, People like jewelers, shop owners), cutters, appraisers) should create a system where people like can review
11.The validation system that we talked about in this project must be included. It should be usable by any user and Dealer=(gem seller, People like jewelers, shop owners) should be able to list it on the ecommerce store after a validation..
If you have any new ideas or suggestions, please include them.
For this, please provide the project file structure and development roadmap in .md files.

You can see the system I am currently building from the project knowledge and the files above.
