14. special note 

This is a gemstone valuation and detail preview system. Here, 1. Select Gemstone, 2. Select Cut Shape, 3. Select Color, 4. grade, these options are required. The others are optional. Here, when you select the options one by one, they should be displayed right side. Use the popup models for select options and include a search bar. (then show gemstone image and its color preview and rgb code and hex code) please provide a new structure that suits my requirements. make it mobile friendly and responsively. 

1. This system should be able to save the details that a user enters.
2. The gemstone related to the saved details should be able to be saved as public and draft in his profile.
3. There should be an admin panel and a backend system to manage this user.
4. The data in the data folder here should be able to be entered from the admin panel. (An example data file is provided for you)
Future hopes- {In the future, we hope to create a full-fledged system that includes multivendor jewellery and gem stores, gem cutters profiles, and an ecommerce system, and customize it to suit them. The gemstone listed here should be like NFT. They should be able to transfer ownership from one person to another, and if the user does not want them, they should be unpublished, a gemstone should be a place where all the details from the place where it is mined to the end customer are stored. Like a blockchain

Also, it should be a place where jewellary, gemstone can be bought and sold and traded

Also, a shop or dealer should be able to create a very beautiful store. Like a facebook page}
Is it possible to host the backend + admin panel , frontend and PostgreSQL database system separately? But all of this needs to be developed in localhost first. using windows 11 pgAdmin 4  If this system is suitable for use, use tailwind css, vite, react.
first give me full complete fille structure without docker Provide the best, most scalable and most efficient structure
only fille structure no need any code dont generate codes
